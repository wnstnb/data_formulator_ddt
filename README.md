# Data Formulator Example Project

This repository contains a Python script that generates synthetic financial data to test and demonstrate [Data Formulator](https://github.com/InvestmentSystems/data-formulator), a no-code, drag-and-drop data visualization tool.

## Generated Datasets

The script `make_fake_data.py` creates three interconnected CSV files and puts them in the `data` folder:

1. **bank_data.csv**: Customer account information
   - CustomerID, Name, AccountType, Balance, TransactionCount, Region, JoinDate, IsActive, CreditScore

2. **monthly_balances.csv**: Historical month-end balances for each customer
   - CustomerID, MonthEndDate, Balance

3. **transactions.csv**: Individual transaction records
   - CustomerID, TransactionDate, TransactionType, Description, Amount

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install data_formulator Faker pandas numpy python-dateutil
```

3. Generate the sample data:

```bash
python make_fake_data.py
```

4. Launch Data Formulator:

```bash
data_formulator
# Or if that doesn't work:
python -m data_formulator
```

Data Formulator should open in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

## Using with Data Formulator

1. In Data Formulator, connect to your data by selecting the CSV files generated by the script
2. Explore relationships between customer data, transaction history, and monthly balances
3. Create custom visualizations using Data Formulator's drag-and-drop interface

## Example Use Cases

- Customer segmentation based on balance history and transaction patterns
- Identifying seasonal trends in account activity
- Analyzing transaction types across different account types and regions
- Building dashboards to monitor customer lifetime value
